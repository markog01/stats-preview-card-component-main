## My process

- ## Plan and code.
  I started the project by creating its HTML structure. This part, I can say, is the least time-consuming compared to the other parts of the process.

- ## Styling components.
  After the simple HTML markup, I proceeded to styling that HTML markup with CSS. First of all I added all colors, font and font-sizing informations that i got from styling guide file. When i setup root for that , I started styling that to like as close as possible to design. Altough, it wasn't easy without exact paddings and margins I think i did it very well. After all styling , also I have done very good responsive for all devices.

- ## Test it multiply times.
  I tested it on many devices and it's looking pretty good!


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I haven't learned anything new, but I've been reviewing material from flex and responsive design. This lesson was beneficial to me because I'm increasingly improving in this field.
